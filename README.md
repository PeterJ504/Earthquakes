# Earthquakes

My first attempt using Python. It pulls earthquake data from USGS and displays in a tkinter GUI.

I'm not new to programming (COBOL, Unisys Mapper (yes,I'm old)) but I am new to Python and OOP in particular.

If you have any suggestions for improvement, structural or otherwise, I would be grateful.

To run the code, use the guiEarthquakes.py.
